## Find the flag

**In this challenge, we can download a file:**

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸŒ¸siunam)-[~/ctf/BuckeyeCTF-2022/Misc/keyboardwarrior]
â””â”€# file keyboardwarrior.pcap 
keyboardwarrior.pcap: pcap capture file, microsecond ts (little-endian) - version 2.4 (Bluetooth HCI H4 with pseudo-header, capture length 262144)
```

**It's a pcap file, let's open it in WireShark!**

**In WireShark, we can see that there are lots of BlueTooth packets, and the Human Interface Device is interesting to me, as the challenge's description is talking about `sending some pretty weird stuff`.**

**Let's filter that!**

**After fumbling around, I found that the Human Interface Device packets are something weird, as it only has 1 hex value is different.**

**Now, we can use `tshark` (Command line version of WireShark) to find all the weird hex value:**
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸŒ¸siunam)-[~/ctf/BuckeyeCTF-2022/Misc/keyboardwarrior]
â””â”€# tshark -r keyboardwarrior.pcap -Y "btatt.value" -T fields -e btatt.value > weird_value.txt
```

**Let's clean that up!**

**Then, I also found that in rgbCTF2020, there is a [writeup](https://github.com/spitfirerxf/rgbCTF2020/tree/master/PI1) caught my attention:**

> Keyboard are using certain hexes to send keyboard signal to the host, but it's not in ASCII.

In the writeup, it also include a [keycode dictionary](https://gist.github.com/willwade/30895e766273f606f821568dadebcc1c#file-keyboardhook-py-L42):

Armed with the above information, we can basically find the flag!

**After some find and replace, you'll get this:**

We found the flag!

> Note: The `-` should be an underscore (`_`). Complete flag: `buckeyectf{4v3r4g3_b13_3nj0y3r}`
