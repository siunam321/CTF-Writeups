In this challenge, you'll learn more about `web crawler`. As usual, let's start the instance via the Start button on the top-right, and browse the website.

When you conducting a web application pentest, it's a good practice to check the `robots.txt` file, as there might have some **hidden directories or valuable information**.

`robots.txt` is a txt file that tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on their site. Search engine crawler or spider, is a type of bot that explore the web regularly to find pages to add to their site index. robots.txt is use for `Search Engine Optimization`, or SEO, it lets the site easier to find for the public.

Now, let's check the robots.txt on the instance's website.

As you can see, there are 2 things here. `User-agent:` and `Disallow:`

> User-agent:

User-agent **tells you information about your device and operating system**. Like it tells you about your browser's version, which browser you're using, your operating system, your CPU architecture. You can google `What is my user agent` if you're interested.

Example of my user agent: `Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0`

In the above image, we can see `User-agent: *`, the * means **all user agents are allowed, all crawlers can access to the site.**

> Disallow:

Disallow means **disallowing crawlers to access a specific directory**. In this challenge, we can see `/ingen/` is disallowed, which means crawlers can't access to /ingen/ directory. **BUT we can access to that directory, except crawlers.**

So now why not go to `/ingen/` to see are there any sensitive information?
