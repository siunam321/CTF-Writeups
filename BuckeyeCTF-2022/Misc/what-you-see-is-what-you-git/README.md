**It's a `git` repository!**

**Let's check any logs there!**
```

â””â”€# git log
fatal: your current branch 'main' does not have any commits yet
```

Hmm... Nothing?

**However in the `logs/HEAD`, there are some commits!**
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸŒ¸siunam)-[~/â€¦/Misc/what-you-see-is-what-you-git/what-u-see-is-what-u-git/.git]

**Hmm... Looks like the `refs/heads/main` is missing.**
```

drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4.0K Nov  4 20:12 ..
```

**Normal git repositroy:**
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸŒ¸siunam)-[~/gitrepo/CTF-Writeups/.git]
â””â”€# ls refs/heads/

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   41 Nov  3 06:26 main
```

**Since I have a normal git repository, let's compare both of them.**

**In my normal git repository, the `refs/heads/main` is a hex value, which is the latest commit hash:**
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸŒ¸siunam)-[~/gitrepo/CTF-Writeups/.git]
â””â”€# cat refs/heads/main

```

**However, the challenge's git is missing the latest commit hash!**

**Let's create a new main file before the they hide the flag!!**

**Check all the commits:**
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸŒ¸siunam)-[~/â€¦/Misc/what-you-see-is-what-you-git/what-u-see-is-what-u-git/.git]

```

**Our target hash is: `c4681c8d561653cee9ecbea5d5ca5629adfd67a4`**

**Create a new main file:**
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸŒ¸siunam)-[~/â€¦/Misc/what-you-see-is-what-you-git/what-u-see-is-what-u-git/.git]
â””â”€# nano refs/heads/main

â””â”€# cat refs/heads/main 
c4681c8d561653cee9ecbea5d5ca5629adfd67a4
```

**Check `git log`:**
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸŒ¸siunam)-[~/â€¦/Misc/what-you-see-is-what-you-git/what-u-see-is-what-u-git/.git]
