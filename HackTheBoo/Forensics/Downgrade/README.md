# Downgrade

## Background

> During recent auditing, we noticed that network authentication is not forced upon remote connections to our Windows 2012 server. That led us to investigate our system for suspicious logins further. Provided the server's event logs, can you find any suspicious successful login?

> Difficulty: Medium

- Overall difficulty for me: Medium

Which event log contains information about logon and logoff events? (for example: Setup)
> 
```

**To inspect those logs, I'll fire up my Windows 10 Pro virtual machine, and transfer those logs:**
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸŒ¸siunam)-[~/ctf/HackTheBoo/Forensics/Downgrade]
â””â”€# python3 -m http.server 80    
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...

PS C:\Users\Student\Desktop> Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://192.168.183.141/forensics_downgrade.zip -OutFile forensics_downgrade.zip
```

**In the Event Viewer, we can see that `Security` contains information about logon and logoff events:**

### Question 2

```
What is the event id for logs for a successful logon to a local computer? (for example: 1337)
> 
```

- Answer: 4624

Which is the default Active Directory authentication protocol? (for example: http)
>
```

- Answer: Kerberos

```
Which is the default Active Directory authentication protocol? (for example: http)
> Kerberos
[+] Correct!
```

### Question 4

```
Looking at all the logon events, what is the AuthPackage that stands out as different from all the rest? (for example: http)
>
```

![](https://github.com/siunam321/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/HackTheBoo/Forensics/Downgrade/images/a3.png)

- Answer: NTLM

```
Looking at all the logon events, what is the AuthPackage that stands out as different from all the rest? (for example: http)

> NTLM
[+] Correct!
```

### Question 5

```
What is the timestamp of the suspicious login (yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss) UTC? (for example, 2021-10-10T08:23:12)
>
```

**After going through all the NTLM AuthPackage, I found 1 login log very sussy:**
