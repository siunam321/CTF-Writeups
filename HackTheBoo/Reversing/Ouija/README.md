# Ouija

## Background

> You've made contact with a spirit from beyond the grave! Unfortunately, they speak in an ancient tongue of flags, so you can't understand a word. You've enlisted a medium who can translate it, but they like to take their time...

> Difficulty: Easy

- Overall difficulty for me: Very easy

**In this challenge, we can [download a file](https://github.com/siunam321/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/HackTheBoo/Reversing/Ouija/rev_ouija.zip):**

rev_ouija/ouija: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=2cace162c306a34dcfc4837d648d047e2ea339fe, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```

It's an ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable!

## Find the flag

**Let's use `strings` to list all the strings in the executable!** 
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸŒ¸siunam)-[~/â€¦/HackTheBoo/Reversing/Ouija/rev_ouija]
â””â”€# strings ouija
[...]
ZLT{Svvafy_kdwwhk_lg_qgmj_ugvw_escwk_al_wskq_lg_ghlaearw_dslwj!}
Retrieving key.
     
 done!
Hmm, I don't like that one. Let's pick a new one.
Yes, 18 will do nicely.
Let's get ready to start. This might take a while!
This one's a lowercase letter
Wrapping it round...
This one's an uppercase letter!
We can leave this one alone.
Okay, let's write down this letter! This is a pretty complex operation, you might want to check back later.
You're still here?

```

Oh! That looks like a flag, and it's being **rotated**??

**For the sake of simplicity, I'll use a caesar cipher decoder from [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher):**

We found the flag!
