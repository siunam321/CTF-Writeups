# JWT authentication bypass via algorithm confusion

## Introduction

Welcome to my another writeup! In this Portswigger Labs [lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt/algorithm-confusion/lab-jwt-authentication-bypass-via-algorithm-confusion), you'll learn: JWT authentication bypass via algorithm confusion! Without further ado, let's dive in.

- Overall difficulty for me (From 1-10 stars): â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†

## Background

This lab uses a JWT-based mechanism for handling sessions. It uses a robust RSA key pair to sign and verify tokens. However, due to implementation flaws, this mechanism is vulnerable to algorithm confusion attacks.

To solve the lab, first obtain the server's public key. This is exposed via a standard endpoint. Use this key to sign a modified session token that gives you access to the admin panel at `/admin`, then delete the user `carlos`.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

## Exploitation

**Login as user `wiener`:**

```

In the previous labs, we found that the session cookie is using JWT(JSON Web Token) to handle sessions.

**Let's copy and paste that JWT string to [token.dev](https://token.dev), which an online tool that encode or decode JWT:**

As you can see, in the header's `alg`, it's using an algorithm called RS256(RSA + SHA-256), which is an asymmetric algorithm. (Private key & public key)

**In the lab's background, it said:**

> It uses a robust RSA key pair to sign and verify tokens. However, due to implementation flaws, this mechanism is vulnerable to algorithm confusion attacks.

To exploit algorithm confusion attacks, we need to obtain the server's public key. Then, convert the public key to a suitable format. After that, modify your JWT, and finally sign the JWT using the public key.

- Obtain the server's public key:

Servers sometimes expose their public keys as JSON Web Key (JWK) objects via a standard endpoint mapped to `/jwks.json` or `/.well-known/jwks.json`, for example. These may be stored in an array of JWKs called `keys`. This is known as a JWK Set.

```json
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸŒ¸siunam)-[~/ctf/Portswigger-Labs/JWT]
â””â”€# curl -s https://0a8900a103034d96c37942af005e00c5.web-security-academy.net/jwks.json | jq

    }
  ]
}
```

**Found JWK Set in `/jwks.json`.**

- Convert the public key to a suitable format:

Although the server may expose their public key in JWK format, when verifying the signature of a token, it will use its own copy of the key from its local filesystem or database. This may be stored in a different format.

In order for the attack to work, the version of the key that you use to sign the JWT must be identical to the server's local copy. In addition to being in the same format, every single byte must match, including any non-printing characters.

Let's assume that we need the key in **X.509 PEM format**. You can convert a JWK to a PEM using the [JWT Editor](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/26aaa5ded2f74beea19e2ed8345a93dd) extension in Burp as follows:

**Go to JWT Editor Keys tab, and click New RSA Key:**

**In the dialog, paste the JWK that you obtained earlier:**

**Select the PEM radio button and copy the resulting PEM key:**

```

> Note: The end of the public key MUST include a newline(`\n`) character, otherwise it won't work.

**Go to the Decoder tab and Base64-encode the PEM:**

**Go back to the JWT Editor Keys tab and click New Symmetric Key:**

**In the dialog, click Generate to generate a new key in JWK format:**

**Replace the generated value for the `k` parameter with a Base64-encoded PEM key that you just copied:**

**Save the key:**

- Modify your JWT:

Once you have the public key in a suitable format, you can [modify the JWT](https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt/working-with-jwts-in-burp-suite#editing-the-contents-of-jwts) however you like. Just make sure that the `alg` header is set to `HS256`.

**Go back to the `GET /my-account` request in Burp Repeater and switch to the extension-generated JSON Web Token tab:**

**In the header of the JWT, change the value of the `alg` parameter to `HS256`:**

**In the payload, change the value of the `sub` claim to `administrator`:**

**Finally, at the bottom of the tab, click Sign, then select the symmetric key that you generated in the previous section:**

Now, the modified token is signed using the server's public key as the secret key.

Let's try to send a GET request to `/my-account`:

Nice! I'm user `administrator`! Let's copy our newly signed JWT, paste it to our session cookie, and refresh the page:

Let's go to the admin panel and delete user `carlos`!
