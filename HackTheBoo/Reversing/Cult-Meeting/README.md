# Cult Meeting

## Background

> After months of research, you're ready to attempt to infiltrate the meeting of a shadowy cult. Unfortunately, it looks like they've changed their password!

> Difficulty: Easy

- Overall difficulty for me: Very easy

## Find the flag

**In this challenge, we can [download a file](https://github.com/siunam321/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/HackTheBoo/Reversing/Cult-Meeting/rev_cult_meeting.zip) and spawn a docker container:**

![](https://github.com/siunam321/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/HackTheBoo/Reversing/Cult-Meeting/images/a1.png)

**Let's `unzip` that!**
```
┌──(root🌸siunam)-[~/ctf/HackTheBoo/Reversing]
└─# unzip rev_cult_meeting.zip 
Archive:  rev_cult_meeting.zip

```

It's an 64-bit LSB executable.

```

**Looks like we need to find the password!**

**We can use `strings` to list out all the strings in the executable!**
```
┌──(root🌸siunam)-[~/ctf/HackTheBoo/Reversing/rev_cult_meeting]
└─# strings meeting

```

- Found the password: `sup3r_s3cr3t_p455w0rd_f0r_u!`

> **Note: You can also find the password in `ltrace`:**
