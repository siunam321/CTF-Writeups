# where are the robots

## Introduction

Welcome to my another writeup! In this picoGym [challenge](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/4?category=1&page=1&solved=0), you'll learn: Reading web crawler file (`robots.txt`)! Without further ado, let's dive in.

- Overall difficulty for me (From 1-10 stars): ★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆

Description

Can you find the robots? `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:60915

## Enumeration

**Home page:**

Pretty empty.

In the challenge's title and the home page, it's referring to a file called `robots.txt`, which is a file for web crawler (an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web).

**Let's try to read that file:**
```shell
┌[siunam♥earth]-(~/ctf/picoGym/Web-Exploitation)-[2023.03.03|18:14:29(HKT)]
└> curl https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/robots.txt                           
User-agent: *
Disallow: /8028f.html
```

As you can see, **it's disallowing web crawler (not us) to view `/8028f.html`.**

**Let's go there!**
```shell
┌[siunam♥earth]-(~/ctf/picoGym/Web-Exploitation)-[2023.03.03|18:25:41(HKT)]
└> curl -s https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/8028f.html | html2text

Guess you found the robots
picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_8028f}
```

We found the flag!

- **Flag: `picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_8028f}`**
