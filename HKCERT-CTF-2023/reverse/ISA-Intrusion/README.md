There is a sus program written in Bauhinia ISA that seems to hide some flag üëÄ

Maybe you can use your reverse engineering skill as well in a unfamilar environment?

**Note:** There is a guide for this challenge [here](https://hackmd.io/@blackb6a/hkcert-ctf-2023-i-en-a58d115f39feab46).

## Find the Flag

### What Is This Challenge?

**In this challenge, we can go to a web application:**

**We can click the "Load" button to load the custom assembly language that written by Black Bauhinia:**

**Then, we can click the "Run" button to run the assembly code:**

![](https://github.com/siunam321/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/HKCERT-CTF-2023/images/Pasted%20image%2020231113154023.png)

In this challenge, we can also read the documentation of the Bauhinia ISA custom assembly language: [https://hackmd.io/@blackb6a/hkcert-ctf-2023-i-en-a58d115f39feab46](https://hackmd.io/@blackb6a/hkcert-ctf-2023-i-en-a58d115f39feab46).

So, there're tons of stuff we need to digest in the documentation, and I'll try to summarize it:

Bauhinia ISA is a custom assembly language that's similar to Intel's x64 assembly

**Instruction Operands:**

An instruction of Bauhinia ISA has the following format:

```
mnemonic argument1, argument2
```

- **Mnemonic**: a reserved name for a class of instruction operators which have the same function. i.e. `JMP`, `NOP`, `PUSH`
- **Operands**: `argument1` and `argument2` are optional. When present, they take the form of either literals or identifiers for data items.

When two operands are present in an arithmetic or logical instruction, the **right operand is the source** and the **left operand is the destination**.

For example: `MOV R3, 1337` is an instruction. In this case, `MOV` is the mnemonic identifier of an operator, `R3` is the destination operand and `1337` is the source operand.

**Registers:**

There are eight general-purpose registers, namely, `R1`, `R2`, `R3`, `R4`, `R5`, `R6`, `R7` and `R8`.

There are three registers with specific roles:

- `PC`, the program counter
- `FP`, the frame pointer (or the stack base pointer)
- `SP`, the stack pointer

**Memory regions and addresses:**

There are two memory segments defined by Bauhinia ISA, defined by the below table:

|Segment name|Segment address|Segment size|
|---|---|---|
|Code|`0x00400000`|`0x100000`|
|Stack|`0xfff00000`|`0x100000`|

Any access to memory apart from these regions will be considered invalid.

**Initial values:**

When the program executes, the registers and the memory will be initialized by the following values:

- `PC` will be set to the beginning of the code segment, i.e., `0x00400000`,
- `FP` and `SP` will be set to `0xfffffff0`, and
- the code segment will be set to the defined program in string.

**Limitations:**

The interpreter will keep track on the number of steps executed. If there are more than `MAX_STEP_COUNT` steps, the interpreter will stop processing and will return an non-zero exit code, stating that the [step count exceeded](https://hackmd.io/@blackb6a/bauhinia-isa#Exit-code-65-Step-count-exceeded) the limit. At the moment, ***`MAX_STEP_COUNT` is defined to be 131072***.

**Exit codes:**

There're some important exit codes in this challenge:

- Exit code `0`: OK
    - This exit code is called to indicate the program exits successfully.
- Exit code `65`: Step count exceeded
    - This exit code will be triggered when the program has been executed for more than `MAX_STEP_COUNT` steps.

For example, the below program would yield an ‚Äústep count exceeded‚Äù error because it did not terminate properly in `MAX_STEP_COUNT` steps (in reality, it would not terminate).

```
JMP 0x400000
```

### Dynamic Reverse Engineering

Armed with the above information, we can finally tinker with the challenge's assembly code!

**In the web application, we can choose the "Debug Playground" to debug the assembly code:**

![](https://github.com/siunam321/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/HKCERT-CTF-2023/images/Pasted%20image%2020231113161004.png)

**Let's copy the challenge's assembly code to there!**

![](https://github.com/siunam321/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/HKCERT-CTF-2023/images/Pasted%20image%2020231113161100.png)

In the "Debug Playground", we can view the stack and memory. (it's like `gdb` but more user-friendly)

When we run it, it returned exit code `65` (STEP COUNT EXCEEDED).

**To find out why this is happening, we can set a breakpoint at line 1 by clicking line 1:**

![](https://github.com/siunam321/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/HKCERT-CTF-2023/images/Pasted%20image%2020231113161404.png)

**Then run it again:**

![](https://github.com/siunam321/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/HKCERT-CTF-2023/images/Pasted%20image%2020231113161438.png)

Now we triggered the breakpoint, we can either click the "Continue" button to run the code normally, or click the "Step" button to move 1 more step in the code.

**Let's click "Step":**

![](https://github.com/siunam321/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/HKCERT-CTF-2023/images/Pasted%20image%2020231113161623.png)

Now we're at line 2 (address `0x0040000d`)!

**Let's click "Continue" this time:**

![](https://github.com/siunam321/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/HKCERT-CTF-2023/images/Pasted%20image%2020231113161916.png)

**In here, we can see that **the PC's value is `0x0040003b`, which is at line 6.**

Therefore, the runner is stuck at line 5. Let's take a look at line 3 - 5!

```
ADD R1, 1;
LT R1, 100000;
JNZ -35;
```

As you can see, this is a simple loop structure, adding `1` to `R1` each loop, and if `R1` < `100000`, it loops. As the runner can only run `131072` instruction, this makes this exceed the step count.

You can also convert the above loop to Python:

```python
R1 = 0
while R1 < 100000:
    R1 += 1
```

In order to solve exit code `65` (STEP COUNT EXCEEDED) problem, we can perform an action for that, it's called "**patching**".

**Patching is a method to editing the assembly code**, so that we can run different things to make us understand the program more, bypass some restriction and so on. It's also a very useful technique for dynamic analysis in reverse engineering.

**Let's patch `LT`mnemonic's `argument2` to be `0` at line 4!**
```
ADD R1, 1;
LT R1, 0;
JNZ -35;
```

By doing this, the assembly code will not enter the loop because of the condition.

You can think the above patching as the following Python code:

```python
R1 = 0
while R1 < 0:
    R1 += 1
```

**Now, run the patched assembly code again:**

Nice! The runner returned exit code 0 (OK)!

But, where's the flag?? It doesn't get printed to the terminal on the left-corner box.

Hmm... **Maybe it hid in the memory??**

When we run the assembly code, the SP address is at `0xfffffe54`.

**Let's go there!**

![](https://github.com/siunam321/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/HKCERT-CTF-2023/images/Pasted%20image%2020231113163914.png)

**By scrolling down a little bit, the flag is indeed hid in the memory at address `0xffffff88`!**
