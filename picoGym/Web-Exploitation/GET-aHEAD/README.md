# GET aHEAD

## Introduction

Welcome to my another writeup! In this picoGym [challenge](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/132?category=1&page=1), you'll learn: HTTP HEAD method! Without further ado, let's dive in.

- Overall difficulty for me (From 1-10 stars): ★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆

## Find the flag

**Home page:**

**View source page:**
```html
[...]
<form action="index.php" method="GET">
    <input type="submit" value="Choose Red"/>
</form>
[...]
<form action="index.php" method="POST">
    <input type="submit" value="Choose Blue"/>
</form>
[...]
```

In here, we see there are 2 forms, and they both sending a POST request to `index.php`.

**When we click those buttons, it'll change the background color to red or blue:**

Seems nothing right?

In the challenge's title, it has a hint: `HEAD` HTTP method.

> The **HTTP `HEAD` method** requests the [headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) that would be returned if the `HEAD` request's URL was instead requested with the HTTP [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) method. For example, if a URL might produce a large download, a `HEAD` request could read its [`Content-Length`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Length) header to check the filesize without actually downloading the file. (From [Mozilla web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/HEAD))

**Armed with above information, we can use `curl` with the `-i` flag to send a `HEAD` method request:**
```shell
┌[siunam♥earth]-(~/ctf/picoGym/Web-Exploitation)-[2023.03.03|16:43:47(HKT)]
└> curl -I http://mercury.picoctf.net:15931/         
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
flag: picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_82880908}
Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

We found the flag!

- **Flag: `picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_82880908}`**
