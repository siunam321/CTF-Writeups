LakeCTF is a jeopardy-style security hacking contest organized by the [polygl0ts](https://polygl0ts.ch/) CTF team (plus some friends!) and the [EPFL School of Computer and Communication Sciences (IC)](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/).

Participants first compete in an online qualification round, and the qualified teams will physically compete in the finals in Lausanne. The top teams will have the unique chance to meet the top members of the EPFL research community.

We wish you the best of luck !
