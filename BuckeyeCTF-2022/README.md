**Frequently Asked Questions**

What is the format?

Teams will compete to earn points by completing challenges from various categories. Past categories have included **cryptography**, **reverse engineering**, **web exploitation**, and **binary exploitation**. There are **prizes** for some divisions.

**How big are the teams? What if I don't have a team?**

See the table above. There will be a team-forming event prior to CTF weekend, and we also anticipate many Ohio State teams forming at the kickoff event.

**I've never done a CTF before, can I still participate?**

Absolutely! Above all, a CTF is an opportunity to learn something new. There will be problems appropriate for all experience levels, and you can count on teammates to help you if you get stuck.
